# Finger

Webfinger server written in Go.

## Features
- üç∞  Easy YAML configuration
- ü™∂  Single 8MB binary / 0% idle CPU / 4MB idle RAM
- ‚ö°Ô∏è   Sub millisecond responses at 10,000 request per second
- üê≥  10MB Docker image

## Install

Via `go install`:

```bash
go install git.maronato.dev/maronato/finger@latest
```

Via Docker:

```bash
docker run --name finger /
    -p 8080:8080 /
    git.maronato.dev/maronato/finger
```

## Usage

If you installed it using `go install`, run
```bash
finger serve
```
To start the server on port `8080`. Your resources will be queryable via `locahost:8080/.well-known/webfinger?resource=<your-resource>`

If you're using Docker, the use the same command in the install section.

By default, no resources will be exposed. You can create resources via a `fingers.yml` file. It should contain a collection of resources as keys and their attributes as their objects.

Some default URN aliases are provided via the built-in mapping ([`urns.yml`](./urns.yml)). You can replace that with your own or use URNs directly in the `fingers.yml` file.

Here's an example:
```yaml
# fingers.yml

# Resources go in the root of the file. Email address will have the acct: 
# prefix added automatically.
alice@example.com:
  # "avatar" is an alias of "http://webfinger.net/rel/avatar"
  # (see urns.yml for more)
  avatar: "https://example.com/alice-pic"

  # If the value is a URI, it'll be exposed as a webfinger link
  openid: "https://sso.example.com/"

  # If the value of the attribute is not a URI, it will be exposed as a
  # webfinger property
  name: "Alice Doe"

  # You can also specify URN's directly instead of the aliases
  http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page: "https://example.com/user/alice"

bob@example.com:
  name: Bob Foo
  openid: "https://sso.example.com/"

# Resources can also be URIs
https://example.com/user/charlie:
  name: Charlie Baz
  profile: https://example.com/user/charlie
```

## Commands

Finger exposes two commands: `serve` and `healthcheck`. `serve` is the default command and starts the server. `healthcheck` is used by the Docker healthcheck to check if the server is up.

## Configs
Here are the config options available. You can change them via command line flags or environment variables:

| CLI flag            | Env variable     | Default                                | Description                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `-p, --port`        | `WF_PORT`        | `8080`                                 | Port where the server listens to       |
| `-h, --host`        | `WF_HOST`        | `localhost` (`0.0.0.0` when in Docker) | Host where the server listens to       |
| `-f, --finger-file` | `WF_FINGER_FILE` | `fingers.yml`                          | Path to the webfingers definition file |
| `-u, --urn-file`    | `WF_URN_FILE`    | `urns.yml`                             | Path to the URNs alias file            |
| `-d, --debug`       | `WF_DEBUG`       | `false`                                | Enable debug logging                   |

## Development

You need to have [Go](https://golang.org/) installed to build the project.

Clone the repo and run `make build` to build the binary. You can then run `./finger serve` to start the server.

A few other commands are:
 - `make run` to run the server
 - `make test` to run the tests
 - `make lint` to run the linter
 - `make clean` to clean the build files
